## Background

Credentials added to this package are to be used with CHAPI Issuer Playground
tool.

## Install

- Node.js 18+ is required.

### Development

```
git clone https://github.com/credential-handler/vc-examples.git
cd vc-examples
npm install
```

To run test:

```
npm test
```

## Usage

### Add / Update a Verifiable Credential

To add or update credentials in the `./credentials` directory:

1. Within the `./credentials` directory, create a new directory for the
credential. Make sure to use kebab case for the directory name.
2. Inside the newly created credential directory, add a `credential.json` file.
This file should contain all the necessary information for the credential,
including the issuer, credential subject, and other relevant data, for example
`./credentials/movie-ticket/credential.json`. The credential MUST be conformant
to [VC Data Model 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model#credentials).
3. Additionally, place a logo `image` file for the credential in the
corresponding directory. The image file should be in either `JPG` or `PNG`
format, for example `./credentials/movie-ticket/image.png`.

### Add / Update a Credential Context

To optionally add or update contexts in the `./contexts` directory:

1. If you wish to include a context for a credential, create a new directory
for the context in the `./contexts` directory. Make sure to use kebab case for
the directory name. It should contain a file `v1.json` that should contain the
JSON-LD context definition for the credential, for example
`./contexts/movie-ticket/v1.json`. The context MUST be conformant
to [VC Data Model 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#contexts).
2. Please note that once a context is created, it becomes locked and cannot be
modified. If you want to update or make changes to a context, you must create a
new context file with a new version within the context directory. For instance,
if you want to update the context for the "Alumni" credential, create a new file
named `v2.json` containing the updated JSON-LD context definition within
`./contexts/alumni`. The previous version,`v1.json`, should be retained in the
directory without any modifications.
3. Please make sure that the context URLs for the contexts created in the
`./contexts` directory follow the format:
`https://contexts.vcplyaground.org/examples/foo-bar/v1.json`.
4. In case you need to add a custom vocabulary documentation, you can include a
`vocab` directory within your `./contexts/foo-bar` context directory. Inside the
`./contexts/foo-bar/vocab` directory, you can define the vocabularies within an
`index.html` file.
