## Background

Credentials added to this package are to be used with CHAPI Issuer Playground
tool.

## Install

- Node.js 18+ is required.

```
git clone https://github.com/credential-handler/vc-examples.git
cd vc-examples
npm install
```

To run test:

```
npm test
```

## Usage

### Add / Update a Verifiable Credential

To add or update credentials in the `./credentials` directory:

1. Within the `./credentials` directory, create a new directory for the
credential. Make sure to use camel case for the directory name.
2. Inside the newly created credential directory, add a `credential.json` file.
This file should contain all the necessary information for the credential,
including the issuer, credential subject, and other relevant data.
3. Additionally, place a logo `image` file for the credential in the
corresponding directory. The image file should be in either `JPG` or `PNG`
format.

### Add / Update a Credential Context

To optionally add or update contexts in the `./contexts` directory:

1. If you wish to include a context for a credential, for instance, if you want
to add a context for the "University Degree" credential, create a file called
`universityDegree-context-v1.json` in the `./contexts` directory. This file
should contain the JSON-LD context definition for the credential.
2. Please note that once a context is created, it becomes locked and cannot be
modified. If you want to update or make changes to a context, you must create a
new context file with a new version. For instance, if you want to update the
context for the "University Degree" credential, create a new file named
`universityDegree-context-v2.json` containing the updated JSON-LD context
definition. The previous version, `universityDegree-context-v1.json`, should be
retained in the directory without any modifications.
3. Please note that for the contexts created in the `./contexts` directory, the
context URL should be of the following format -
`https://contexts.vcplyaground.org/examples/movie-ticket/v1.json`.

### Get the path to credentials directory
