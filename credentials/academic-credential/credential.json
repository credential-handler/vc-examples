            "description": "Critically explores the nature of digital communications and expanded definitions of what counts as text and as literate expression in the 21st century. Emphasizes the 21st-century skills and abilities required for and fostered by digital communications (e.g., collaboration, multitasking, intertextual analyses) and examines the newest technologies that enable digital communications (e.g., digital storytelling, virtual worlds, social media, digital crafting, video gaming/modding). In doing so, focuses on the intersections of technologies and the arts as literate communications with implications for teaching and learning. Participants explore these topics through readings, videos and Web sites and by reflecting on their own experiences. Students respond to questions/prompts through online discussions, reflective thought papers, and media or virtual presentations.",
