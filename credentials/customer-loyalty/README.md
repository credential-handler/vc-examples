# Customer Loyalty Card: CustomerLoyaltyCredential

Retail establishments often offer a [loyalty
program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program) to encourage customers
to make repeat purchases. A loyalty program typically involves a customer
signing up for a program and receiving a loyalty card. The customer presents the
loyalty card at the point of sale to receive discounts or other benefits. The
loyalty card is typically a plastic card with a barcode or magnetic stripe that
can be scanned at the point of sale. The loyalty card is associated with a
customer account identifier, so that the store can track the customer's
purchases and apply rewards.

A `CustomerLoyaltyCredential` is a digital representation of a loyalty card. It
can be presented by a customer to a retailer to receive discounts or other
benefits. The credential asserts the customer account identifier and optionally
which location the card is associated with. The credential is signed and
verified by the retailer.
